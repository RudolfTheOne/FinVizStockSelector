It retrieves overview, financial, and valuation data for stocks using the FinvizFinance library.

The retrieved data is filtered based on following criteria: 
1. price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is under 40
2. institutional ownership is under 80%
3. EPS growth is over 10%
4. market capitalization is +Mid (over $2bln)

The dataframe is ranked based on metrics such as profit margin, EPS growth, and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio.
The total rank is calculated by summing the ranks from different metrics.

The selected stock tickers are written to a text file named 'sorted_filtered_tickers.txt'.

In summary, this code helps filter and rank stocks based on their financial scores and metrics, allowing users to identify potentially promising investment opportunities.
